This repo is intended to provide the contents of a FreeBSD ports tree leaf: games/godot so that those who desire may obtain and build their own. This will follow the github repo with updates as frequent as I am able, tied to commits there. My commits to be ONE day behind in order to avoid multiple commits of the same date.


The official port is in devel/godot which is different than the minetest engine and its associated initial game, you can place the leaf contents in a directory that makes the best sense to you.
